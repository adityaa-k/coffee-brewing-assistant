If you're just starting your coffee brewing journey, you might have come across terms like "1:15 ratio" and wondered what they mean. Don't worry, it's simpler than it sounds, and understanding it can significantly improve your coffee-making skills.

---

### ‚òï What Is a Coffee Brewing Ratio?

A coffee brewing ratio is the relationship between the amount of coffee grounds and the amount of water used during brewing. It's typically expressed as a ratio, such as 1:15, meaning 1 part coffee to 15 parts water by weight.

For example:
- **1:15 Ratio:** 1 gram of coffee for every 15 grams (or milliliters) of water.

This ratio helps determine the strength and flavor of your coffee. A lower second number (e.g., 1:12) results in a stronger brew, while a higher number (e.g., 1:18) yields a milder cup.

---

### üìè Why Is the 1:15 Ratio Popular?

The 1:15 ratio is a common starting point for many brewing methods because it offers a balanced cup‚Äîneither too strong nor too weak. It's especially popular for methods like pour-over and French press.

Here's how it breaks down:
- **20 grams of coffee** √ó **15** = **300 grams of water**

This means you'd use 20 grams of coffee and 300 grams of water to brew your cup.

---

### üîÑ Adjusting Ratios to Taste

Your perfect cup might differ based on personal preference. Here's a general guide:

| Ratio | Strength | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1:12  | Strong   | Bold, intense flavor |
| 1:15  | Medium   | Balanced, standard strength |
| 1:18  | Light    | Milder, subtle flavors |

Feel free to experiment within this range to find what suits your taste best.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools to Help You Get Started

To accurately measure your coffee and water, consider using:
- **Digital Scale:** Ensures precise measurements.
- **Measuring Spoons/Cups:** Useful if you don't have a scale, though less accurate.
- **[Coffee Brewing Assistant](/):** CBA can help determine the right amounts based on your desired ratio.

### The Science Behind Iced V60 That Actually Tastes Good (Thanks, James Hoffmann)

---

There‚Äôs a fine line between iced coffee that tastes **balanced and refreshing**, and one that tastes like **sour regret in a glass**. Trust me‚ÄîI‚Äôve been on both sides.

But then I stumbled upon James Hoffmann‚Äôs [iced V60](/blog/iced-v60-grind-size-mistake) method, and it changed how I look at brewing over ice. This post breaks down what makes it work‚Äîand why the method is more science than guesswork.

---

### ‚òï The Golden Ratio

The base formula? It‚Äôs backed by coffee brewing science and just feels *right* in the cup:

* **65g of coffee per 1000ml of total brew liquid**  
* **60:40 split** ‚Äì 60% hot water to extract, 40% ice to flash chill  
* **2x‚Äì3x bloom ratio** ‚Äì Use 2‚Äì3x the coffee weight for bloom water

> For example, if you‚Äôre brewing 20g coffee, you‚Äôll bloom with ~40‚Äì60g of water and aim for a total of 300g brew liquid (180g water + 120g ice).

This ratio nails both **flavor clarity** and **strength**, without over-diluting.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Adaptive Timing (The App‚Äôs Superpower)

What‚Äôs cool is that **[Coffee Brewing Assistant](/app)** adapts the brew dynamically based on your input. That means:

* **Bloom count:** Ranges between 2‚Äì4 pours based on how much coffee you‚Äôre using  
* **Bloom duration:** Adjusts between 45‚Äì55 seconds ‚Äî long enough to degas, not long enough to stall  
* **Water distribution:** Automatically spaces out water doses for consistent saturation

You don‚Äôt have to do mental math mid-brew. It thinks for you.

---

### üî¨ Brewing Science in Action

This method isn‚Äôt a gimmick. It‚Äôs built on brewing principles that just work.

* **Fine grind:** Yes, finer than hot pour-over. It slows down the drain and helps balance flavor in short contact time.  
* **90‚Äì96¬∞C water:** The perfect range to extract sweetness and nuance from lighter roasts.  
* **CO‚ÇÇ bloom:** That first pour? It‚Äôs all about degassing your grounds so that later pours can evenly extract.  
* **Ice dilution:** The app pre-calculates how much ice you need to land at the *ideal* final concentration. Genius.

---

> ‚ÄúIf your brew drains too quickly, you‚Äôre not extracting enough. If your brew tastes hollow, your ice ratio might be off. This method solves both.‚Äù  

---

### Why I Switched

Before I tried Hoffmann‚Äôs method (and plugged it into the app), my iced V60s were hit or miss. Either they were over-diluted or they had weird sour notes.

Now? It‚Äôs consistently bright, balanced, and repeatable.

And honestly, that‚Äôs what great iced coffee should be: **consistently craveable**.

---

### FAQs

**Q1: What grind size should I use for iced V60?**  
Use a grind finer than hot V60. On most hand grinders, aim for a setting you‚Äôd use just before hitting espresso range.

**Q2: Can I adjust the water-to-ice ratio?**  
You can, but 60:40 hot water to ice is optimal for most recipes ‚Äî enough to extract and chill without over-dilution.

**Q3: Why is bloom timing so important?**  
The bloom allows CO‚ÇÇ to escape from fresh coffee, which makes the rest of your extraction more even and flavorful.

**Q4: Can I skip the app and just eyeball it?**  
You can try ‚Äî but the app helps dial in variables like bloom cycles, water volume, and ice weight for better consistency.

### A Grind Size Lesson with Fraction 9s Honeycrust

---

**TL;DR:**  
Brewed an iced V60 using Fraction 9s Honeycrust at 63 clicks. It tasted bad, sour and under-extracted. The culprit? Coarse grind size. Lesson learned: go finer. Read on to avoid the same mistake.

---

### A Fresh Bag and a Bold Plan

I recently ordered **Whole Bean Honeycrust** from *Fraction 9*,  a **100% Arabica** grown at **Kalyancool Estate, Chikmagalur (1300m)**. With its **light-plus roast**, its perfect for flash-chilled brews or iced V60 recipes.

To dial in the best cup, I planned to **start with a coarse grind** and move finer with each brew.

*Bad idea to start at 63 clicks.* More on that soon.

---

### Brew Setup: The Numbers

* **Beans:** 20g  
* **Grind Setting:** 63 clicks using Kingrinder P2  
* **Water:** 200g  
* **Ice:** 133g  
* **Method:** 4 pours of 50g, 45 seconds apart  
* **App Used:** [CoffeeBrewingAssistant.com](https://coffeebrewingassistant.com/)

> **Pro tip:** For iced V60, I use 20g coffee instead of the usual 15g I use for hot.

---

### The Moment I Knew I Messed Up

> As I poured the first bloom, the water drained straight through.  
> Thats when I knew: **the grind was way too coarse.**

Still, I followed through. I chilled the brew and took a sip. It was bad, **very sour, hollow, and under-extracted.**

---

### What Went Wrong?

If your **bloom water drops straight into the server**, your grind is too coarse.

* It doesnt allow enough contact time.  
* The coffee bed doesnt saturate properly.  
* The result? A watery, acidic cup lacking depth.

---

### What I will Try Next

I will grind **finer next time ‚Äî around 50 to 55 clicks** on the Kingrinder P2. This should slow the drawdown and allow proper extraction.

> Every bad brew is just a stepping stone to your next great cup.

Stay tuned! I will update you with results in my next blog.

---

### Key Takeaway

> **If your iced V60 tastes sour or underwhelming, dont panic.**  
> Its probably your grind size. Go finer and test again.

---

### FAQs

**Q1: Why does my iced V60 coffee taste sour or weak?**  
Because its likely under-extracted. Try a **finer grind size** and ensure you're using correct ratios.

There's a quiet elegance to the Japanese method of brewing iced coffee. Unlike cold brew, which steeps for hours and often results in a smooth but one-dimensionally chocolatey flavor, the iced pour-over method is a **vibrant, immediate celebration of the coffee bean itself.**

### The Magic is in the Method

The principle is simple: brew a concentrated batch of hot coffee directly over a measured amount of ice. As the hot coffee drips, it melts the ice, chilling instantly and diluting to the perfect strength. This rapid chilling process is the key‚Äîit locks in the volatile aromatic compounds that are often lost during slow, cold extraction. 

> The result? A cup that is simultaneously bright, complex, and *deeply refreshing*. You preserve the delicate floral and fruity notes of a high-quality single-origin bean that would otherwise be muted.

### A Symphony of Variables

Achieving the perfect balance requires precision. That's what our app is for. We manage the 'golden ratio' for you:

* **Coffee-to-Water Ratio:** We start with a stronger brew to account for the dilution from the ice.
* **Ice Mass:** The amount of ice isn't random; it's a calculated part of the total water in your recipe.
* **Grind Size:** A finer grind is typically needed to ensure proper extraction in the shorter time the water is in contact with the coffee grounds.

By controlling these variables, you are not just making cold coffee; you are crafting a precise, aromatic beverage that showcases the true potential of your beans. It‚Äôs a method that rewards care and attention with a cup that is second to none.`

Of all the variables in coffee brewing, none has a more dramatic impact on the final taste than **grind size**. It is the single most powerful tool a home brewer has to dial in their recipe. Too coarse, and your coffee will be weak, sour, and under-extracted. Too fine, and you'll end up with a bitter, harsh, and over-extracted brew.

### Understanding Extraction

Think of extraction as the process of water dissolving flavors from coffee grounds. The total surface area of the coffee particles dictates how quickly this happens.

| Grind Size | Surface Area | Ideal For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Coarse | Low | French Press, Cold Brew |
| Medium | Medium | Drip Brewers, V60 |
| Fine | High | Espresso, Moka Pot |

For pour-over methods like the V60, we aim for a **medium-fine grind**, somewhere between table salt and sand. This provides the ideal balance for the 2-4 minute brew time, allowing the water to extract the sweet, desirable compounds without pulling out the bitter ones that come later.

> A small adjustment can make a world of difference. Your grinder is not just a tool to break beans; it is your primary control for flavor. Master it, and you will master your brew.`

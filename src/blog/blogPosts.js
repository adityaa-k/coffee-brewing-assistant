### A Grind Size Lesson with Fraction 9s Honeycrust

---

**TL;DR:**  
Brewed an iced V60 using Fraction 9s Honeycrust at 63 clicks. It tasted bad, sour and under-extracted. The culprit? Coarse grind size. Lesson learned: go finer. Read on to avoid the same mistake.

---

### A Fresh Bag and a Bold Plan

I recently ordered **Whole Bean Honeycrust** from *Fraction 9*,  a **100% Arabica** grown at **Kalyancool Estate, Chikmagalur (1300m)**. With its **light-plus roast**, its perfect for flash-chilled brews or iced V60 recipes.

To dial in the best cup, I planned to **start with a coarse grind** and move finer with each brew.

*Bad idea to start at 63 clicks.* More on that soon.

---

### Brew Setup: The Numbers

* **Beans:** 20g  
* **Grind Setting:** 63 clicks using Kingrinder P2  
* **Water:** 200g  
* **Ice:** 133g  
* **Method:** 4 pours of 50g, 45 seconds apart  
* **App Used:** [CoffeeBrewingAssistant.com](https://coffeebrewingassistant.com/)

> **Pro tip:** For iced V60, I use 20g coffee instead of the usual 15g I use for hot.

---

### The Moment I Knew I Messed Up

> As I poured the first bloom, the water drained straight through.  
> Thats when I knew: **the grind was way too coarse.**

Still, I followed through. I chilled the brew and took a sip. It was bad, **very sour, hollow, and under-extracted.**

---

### What Went Wrong?

If your **bloom water drops straight into the server**, your grind is too coarse.

* It doesnt allow enough contact time.  
* The coffee bed doesnt saturate properly.  
* The result? A watery, acidic cup lacking depth.

---

### What I will Try Next

I will grind **finer next time — around 50 to 55 clicks** on the Kingrinder P2. This should slow the drawdown and allow proper extraction.

> Every bad brew is just a stepping stone to your next great cup.

Stay tuned! I will update you with results in my next blog.

---

### Key Takeaway

> **If your iced V60 tastes sour or underwhelming, dont panic.**  
> Its probably your grind size. Go finer and test again.

---

### FAQs

**Q1: Why does my iced V60 coffee taste sour or weak?**  
Because its likely under-extracted. Try a **finer grind size** and ensure you're using correct ratios.

**Q2: What grind size is best for iced V60 using Kingrinder P2?**  
Start between **50-55 clicks** for light roasts. Adjust by taste and flow rate.

**Q3: Why is my V60 brew water draining too fast?**  
That usually means your grind is **too coarse**. Try grinding finer for better flavor extraction.

**Q4: How much coffee and water should I use for a single-person iced V60?**  
Use **20g coffee**, **200g brew water**, and **133g ice** for a bright and balanced brew.

There's a quiet elegance to the Japanese method of brewing iced coffee. Unlike cold brew, which steeps for hours and often results in a smooth but one-dimensionally chocolatey flavor, the iced pour-over method is a **vibrant, immediate celebration of the coffee bean itself.**

### The Magic is in the Method

The principle is simple: brew a concentrated batch of hot coffee directly over a measured amount of ice. As the hot coffee drips, it melts the ice, chilling instantly and diluting to the perfect strength. This rapid chilling process is the key—it locks in the volatile aromatic compounds that are often lost during slow, cold extraction. 

> The result? A cup that is simultaneously bright, complex, and *deeply refreshing*. You preserve the delicate floral and fruity notes of a high-quality single-origin bean that would otherwise be muted.

### A Symphony of Variables

Achieving the perfect balance requires precision. That's what our app is for. We manage the 'golden ratio' for you:

* **Coffee-to-Water Ratio:** We start with a stronger brew to account for the dilution from the ice.
* **Ice Mass:** The amount of ice isn't random; it's a calculated part of the total water in your recipe.
* **Grind Size:** A finer grind is typically needed to ensure proper extraction in the shorter time the water is in contact with the coffee grounds.

By controlling these variables, you are not just making cold coffee; you are crafting a precise, aromatic beverage that showcases the true potential of your beans. It’s a method that rewards care and attention with a cup that is second to none.`

Of all the variables in coffee brewing, none has a more dramatic impact on the final taste than **grind size**. It is the single most powerful tool a home brewer has to dial in their recipe. Too coarse, and your coffee will be weak, sour, and under-extracted. Too fine, and you'll end up with a bitter, harsh, and over-extracted brew.

### Understanding Extraction

Think of extraction as the process of water dissolving flavors from coffee grounds. The total surface area of the coffee particles dictates how quickly this happens.

| Grind Size | Surface Area | Ideal For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Coarse | Low | French Press, Cold Brew |
| Medium | Medium | Drip Brewers, V60 |
| Fine | High | Espresso, Moka Pot |

For pour-over methods like the V60, we aim for a **medium-fine grind**, somewhere between table salt and sand. This provides the ideal balance for the 2-4 minute brew time, allowing the water to extract the sweet, desirable compounds without pulling out the bitter ones that come later.

> A small adjustment can make a world of difference. Your grinder is not just a tool to break beans; it is your primary control for flavor. Master it, and you will master your brew.`
